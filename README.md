# 42_libft

`42_libft` is a personal library of standard C functions reimplemented as part of the 42 School curriculum. This library serves as a foundational project for future 42 School projects and aims to extend the set of utility functions available for those projects. As I have worked on future projects I have continued to add more useful functions to this library including ft_printf & get_next_line.
